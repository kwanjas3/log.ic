Game Dedicated to introducing basic concepts of programming to kids.
On a grid based system I want to design an escape the maze style game that uses fundamental programming concepts and logic.
Using C semantics without using C syntax.

Goals of the Game: simultaneously save each chapter as usable Functions
At the end of the game:
  1. player will understand variables.
  2. player will understand functions and code blocks
  3. player will understand basic logic concepts
    Boolean, mathematics, iterative
  4. game will introduce true/false.
    Tutorial will hint right in the beginning on unintuitive ways of expressing boolean values
    !(>=, <=, ==, >, <) || and &&
  
  5. game will introduce math.
  6. game will introduce if else if
  7. Loop statements
    While, do while, for
    counters
    
    // if time permits I want to expand on a maze creator similar to mario maker to let kids design levels.


Declaring Variables and Types
-	With respect to the game, main function will be the player
-	start with declaring movement, with movement aka (move right, 10 times)
Tutorial level:
1.	Name your minion: simulates a function program
	//have the game function with simple arguments: 
2.	lets move our minion up 3 spaces:
	Player.MoveUp(3);
	//lets have the minion pickup quest item
	Player.PickUp(Right);
	//player finds a tutorial fairy we should find the exit
	Player.MoveLeft(3);
	Player.MoveUp(3);
	Player.Use(Item);
  Item.Open(object);

Done.
